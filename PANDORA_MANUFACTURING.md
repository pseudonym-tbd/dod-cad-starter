## 1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW

### 1.1 Mission
Cruise missiles concealed in standard 40' ISO shipping containers enabling covert global pre-positioning with 5-year standby life and secure satellite trigger.

### 1.2 Strategic Rationale
- Covert pre-positioning globally
- Impossible to distinguish from commercial shipping
- 5-year unattended standby
- Secure satellite activation
- 6:1 favorable cost exchange

### 1.3 LEGAL/TREATY WARNINGS
**This system raises significant legal concerns:**
- May violate LOAC regarding perfidy (disguising military as civilian)
- Creates risk of adversary targeting civilian shipping
- Undermines arms control verification regimes
- Requires legal review before any deployment

### 1.4 Key Performance Parameters

| Container Type | Standard 40' ISO |
| Missiles per Container | 4 |
| Standby Life | 5 years |
